                                <p>Tom Vigilante, Jr., President and Founder of Centralized Vision, is an expert in innovative security solutions after spending more than 22 years in the security industry. Headquartered in Phoenix, Centralized Vision is a leading company that offers real-time video surveillance services to provide safety and security for companies and families throughout the world.</p>
                                <p>With his wife Tami, Vigilante founded Centralized Vision in 2007 after hearing the frustrations of business owners who had difficulty in preventing property damage and theft with un-monitored security cameras. Harnessing innovations in technology and increased bandwidth on the Internet that enabled live video streaming, Vigilante developed an innovative security platform. From its conception, CV has provided pro-active protection of property and assets for companies by using remote-camera monitoring with real-time response options. Today’s CV acts a remote guard, remote concierge and a remote engineer as needed. At a central station equipped with safety-certified operators and video technicians 24 hours a day, Centralized Vision now provides real-time monitoring for companies such as auto dealerships, construction facilities, retail centers, schools, entertainment facilities, sporting venues, recycling facilities, office buildings and warehouse distribution centers.</p>
                                <p>Vigilante received his start in the security industry while in high school as a part-time security officer working for Vigilante Security Services (VSS), a small security services company his parents founded in 1988. VSS has since grown to more than 500 employees and has been recognized as Arizona’s No. 1 security company by Ranking Arizona Magazine.</p>
                                <p>After attending college and developing a strong business acumen as a leading salesperson for an office solutions company, Vigilante returned to work at VSS as a Sales Representative in 1999 and created $2.5 million in sales in the first year. As VSS continued to grow with more efficiency through redeveloped marketing campaigns and customer-service programs, Vigilante was promoted to Vice President, Senior Vice President and Executive Vice President. He has been active with many associations, such as the American Society for Industrial Security (ASIS) Phoenix Chapter, Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) of Greater Phoenix, National Association of Industrial and Office Properties (NAIOP) and Arizona Association of Community Managers (AACM).</p>
                                <p>Prior to earning a degree in Sociology with a minor in Communication from Arizona State University in 1996, Vigilante played baseball at Glendale Community College, University of Arizona and Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego. He and his wife, Tami, currently reside in Scottsdale, Ariz. with their children Dayne and Tatum.</p>

                                <p>Tami Vigilante, Chief Financial Officer and Co-Founder of Centralized Vision, developed core customer service philosophies that have enabled the company to grow rapidly while maintaining strong client retention. She and her husband, Tom Jr., founded Centralized Vision more than a decade ago after hearing from frustrated business owners who had difficulty in preventing property damage and theft with un-monitored security cameras. Having served CV in a variety of roles since its conception, she is currently focused on HR, marketing and accounting responsibilities.</p>
                                <p>Having started her career in business and marketing, Vigilante knows well what it means to put the customer’s needs first. She developed her customer service and office management skills while working for IKON Office Solutions for seven years. She began her career as an Office Manager and was quickly promoted to Assistant for the company’s Vice President of Sales & Marketing, which allowed her to develop customer service strategies while networking with new business clients. Vigilante became a Junior Sales Representative and supported a team of five Senior Sales Representatives before owning her own territory as a Sales Representative. She met her husband while working at IKON and left her position to start a family while Tom rejoined his parent’s security company, Vigilante Security Services (VSS), as a Vice President. Since 2007, her talents have helped fuel the evolution of Centralized Vision from a concept to a fully-realized business with many satisfied clients.</p>
                                <p>As the mother of two children, Dayne and Tatum, Vigilante is proud that Centralized Vision is providing deterrents and services to make the world safer for her family and others to live in.</p>
