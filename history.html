                                <p>Tom and Tami Vigilante‚Äôs journey into the world of safety and security began with a vision to fulfill a pressing industry need and a passion for making a meaningful impact.</p>
                                <p>In 2007, following successful careers in sales and marketing (as well as an accomplished career in collegiate baseball for Tom), they founded Centralized Vision with a clear mission: To transform customers‚Äô existing surveillance systems‚Äîoften regarded as ‚Äúpassive‚Äù‚Äîinto proactive security solutions through the innovation of live, remote monitoring.</p>
                                <p>Curious by nature and a self-prescribed ‚Äúsolutions guy,‚Äù Tom recognized a gap in the security landscape: There was an abundance of legacy security cameras and related components out there, but how were they being fully utilized for the real-time world? What good was it to have to pour over reels of poor-quality security footage after an incident had occurred?</p>

                <p>Working with Virtual Guard‚Äôs early adopters, auto dealerships and retail shopping centers, Tom realized another immediate need: To augment security cameras with audio talk down.</p>
                <p>Today, Audio Voice Down is referred to in the security industry as ‚ÄúThe Voice of God.‚Äù However, in 2008, the audio talk down movement was in its infancy. For Centralized Vision, it was a logical capability to be coupled with its real-time video surveillance.</p>

                                <p>The commission-based program presents a ‚Äúbetter together‚Äù approach; Centralized Vision and integration channel partners meet the increasing safety and security needs of companies seeking comprehensive, customized solutions.

                                <p>A visionary leader with a successful track record as a top sales and marketing expert in financial services, and creating innovative tools and solutions for measurable results, Rich was instrumental in the creation of Vision Information Center (V.I.C.), Centralized Vision‚Äôs proprietary software designed to drive internal efficiencies.

                                <p>In early 2023, Centralized Vision expanded its National Command Center, more than doubling in size from 1,800 to 5,000 square feet. Here, certified Surveillance Specialists are live 24/7/365, monitoring customer locations throughout the U.S. and Canada.</p>
                                <p>Prior to the center‚Äôs substantial expansion, other areas of the Phoenix-based National Operations Center were also expanded, including staff common areas, operations and information technology. The way Tom puts it, the expanded space lends itself to the company‚Äôs ability to be hyper redundant in safeguarding what matters most to customers.</p>
                                <p>As for the future, the Vigilantes see no end to the aggressive market need for sophisticated monitoring services in the evolving universe of safety and security.
